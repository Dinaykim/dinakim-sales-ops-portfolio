## 📈 Analytics & Data
> ⚡ Note: Several of the SQL and Python examples were originally written as part of my Le Wagon Data Analytics bootcamp.  
> I’ve reformatted and documented them here to highlight business relevance as Sales Ops.

- **SQL Queries**
  - [`pipeline_stage_distribution.sql`](analytics/sql/pipeline_stage_distribution.sql) → Count deals by stage to assess pipeline health, spot bottlenecks, and highlight CRM hygiene issues.  
  - [`revenue_by_category.sql`](analytics/sql/revenue_by_category.sql) → Analyze top categories by revenue & margin, then deep-dive into repeat behavior and product breadth.  
  - [`margin_segmentation.sql`](analytics/sql/margin_segmentation.sql) → Classify deals/products into High/Medium/Low margin tiers to guide sales focus and discounting strategy.

- **Python Notebooks**: exploratory analysis and sales KPI modeling.  
- **dbt Models**: transformations for clean, analysis-ready data.
