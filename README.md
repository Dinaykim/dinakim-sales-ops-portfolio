## 📈 Analytics & Data
> ⚡ Note: Several of the SQL and Python examples were originally written as part of my Le Wagon Data Analytics bootcamp.  
> I’ve reformatted and documented them here to highlight business relevance as Sales Ops.

- **SQL Queries**
  - [`pipeline_stage_distribution.sql`](analytics/sql/pipeline_stage_distribution.sql) → Count deals by stage to assess pipeline health, spot bottlenecks, and highlight CRM hygiene issues.  
  - [`revenue_by_category.sql`](analytics/sql/revenue_by_category.sql) → Analyze top categories by revenue & margin, then deep-dive into repeat behavior and product breadth.  
  - [`margin_segmentation.sql`](analytics/sql/margin_segmentation.sql) → Classify deals/products into High/Medium/Low margin tiers to guide sales focus and discounting strategy.

- **Python Notebooks**:
  - [`sales_kpi_modeling.ipynb`](analytics/python/sales_kpi_modeling.ipynb) → exploratory analysis and sales KPI modeling.

## 🚀 Enablement Frameworks  

- [`onboarding-checklist.md`](enablement/onboarding-checklist.md) → 3-week blended onboarding path with a week-by-week checklist for CRM training, roleplays, shadowing, and certification. Reduced ramp time from 6 months → 3 months.  
- [`competency-framework.md`](enablement/competency-framework.md) → Defines expectations for sales reps across product knowledge, sales process, customer engagement, and collaboration, with clear levels from New Hire to Expert.  
- [`call-evaluation-scorecard.md`](enablement/call-evaluation-scorecard.md) → Coaching tool to evaluate sales calls across opening, discovery, value, objections, and closing, with a structured 1–4 scoring scale and coaching notes.
