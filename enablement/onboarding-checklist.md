# Onboarding Path Checklist (Sample)

## Context
The original onboarding process was spread over 4–5 weeks with multiple live sessions, quizzes, and manager check-ins.  
I streamlined it into a **3-week blended ramp program** to accelerate time-to-productivity while keeping quality high.  
Result: ramp time reduced from ~6 months → 3 months, and sales productivity improved from 40% → 85%.  

## Purpose
Provide a structured, repeatable onboarding path that blends live training, self-learning, shadowing, and certification.  
This ensures consistency across markets, reduces the manager training load, and helps new hires reach quota faster.
