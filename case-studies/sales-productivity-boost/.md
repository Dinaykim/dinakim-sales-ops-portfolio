# Case Study: Boosting Sales Productivity from 40% → 85%

## Context
Sales productivity at Ankorstore was stalled at ~40%. Reps struggled to ramp consistently, managers had no standardised way to coach, and the sales team’s time was often disrupted by ad hoc training requests from other departments. Training was inconsistent across markets, and leadership lacked visibility into whether reps were truly sales-ready.

## Problem
Without a structured enablement approach, sales managers were spending too much time retraining, cross-functional teams pulled sales into one-off sessions, and reps ramped slowly with uneven skills. The lack of measurement meant leaders couldn’t confirm if training was working.

## Action
- **Launched the company’s first LMS** and introduced blended learning (self-paced + live roleplays).  
- Built **training scorecards for managers** to evaluate reps’ skills and track progress.  
- Centralised training requests into a **structured intake process** so sales teams weren’t disrupted by ad hoc cross-functional demands.  
- Created a **knowledge base and certification path** to ensure reps were trained consistently across all markets.  

## Measurement
- For **new hires**: compared performance before vs. after the enablement program, tracking the % of reps hitting quota within their first 3 months.  
- For **existing reps**: monitored improvements in LMS completion, scorecard evaluations, and quota attainment after rollout.  
- This dual view captured both a faster ramp for new hires and greater consistency/productivity for tenured reps.  

## Result
- **Sales productivity rose from 40% → 85%.**  
- Ramp time shortened (6 months → 3 months).  
- Managers had a clear framework to coach reps and confirm readiness.  
- Training became scalable, consistent, and measurable instead of fragmented.  
- Reps hit quota faster, and managers gained back time for deal coaching instead of retraining.
