# Case Study: Improving CRM Data Hygiene

## Context
Pipeline reviews between managers and reps were inconsistent across markets due to unreliable forecasts. Deals were often lacking key data, either missing or unreliable fields like stage, close date, amount.

## Problem
Managers were unable to have effective deal strategy conversations in their one-on-one meetings with sales representatives due to data quality issues. 1:1s were less efficient, with meetings often turning into debates over missing or outdated fields. 

## Action
- Ran a **cross-functional working session** (Sales, RevOps, CS, Marketing, Finance) to identify which fields were **truly decision-critical** for forecasting, booking meetings, and handoffs.  
- **Trimmed mandatory fields** to a minimal, high-signal set (e.g., stage, close date, amount, next step), moving “nice-to-haves” to optional with tooltips/examples.    
- **Standardized stage definitions & exit criteria** and published a single-page cheat sheet.  
- Replaced noisy, generic Slack reminders with **targeted alerts and manager dashboards** that surfaced only missing critical fields.

## Measurement
- Tracked CRM field completeness on critical fields (stage, close date, amount).  
- Used **manager scorecards** to confirm whether reps were keeping deals current.  
- Collected manager feedback on **forecast calls** to validate that meetings shifted from data cleanup to strategy.  

## Result
- Within 4 weeks, **CRM completeness rose to 76%** for the critical fields.  
- Forecast calls became shorter and more strategic.  
- Managers gained confidence in data, enabling better deal coaching and decision-making.

**Headline:** *“Cut mandatory fields to the essentials and added stage-gate checks—lifting CRM completeness to 76% in 4 weeks and restoring forecast trust.”*
